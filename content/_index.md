## About me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.png" alt="avatar">}}

I'm starting a new role as a Machine Learning Researcher for the Dallas Mavericks, where I develop data-based tools for improving player performance. Previously, I worked at the IMF's Risk Unit in Washington D.C, where I helped build crisis prediction models for risk management and contingency planning. I am interested in topics relating to organizational success and decision making in sports and the economy. 

I am a graduate of the American University of Beirut and hold a Master's of Arts in Applied Economics from Georgetown University. Prior to specializing in economics, I was a national basketball player for Team Lebanon U18. Here are [my stats](https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964) from FIBA Asia 2010.
