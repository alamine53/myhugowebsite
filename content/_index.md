## About me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/IMG_3827.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I build AI models at the Dallas Mavericks and Mark Cuban Companies. Prior to joining the Mavs, I worked at the International Monetary Fund, where I developed crisis prediction models for macro risk management and contingency planning.

I have a BA in Economics from the American University of Beirut and a MA in Applied Economics from Georgetown University. 
I was a member of the Lebanese Under-18 national team in [FIBA Asia 2010](https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964) .

## Help Lebanon Carrd

<!-- In 2020, I launched the above site as a landing page for resources on helping local Lebanese communities survive the economic crisis. Weeks later, it became the epicenter for disaster relief initatives as donations rushed in to support the victims of the August 4th Beirut port explosion. Following the blast, which killed 218 and left numerous without shelter, traffic on the site surged instantly, and I quickly repurposed it to cater for those looking for ways to help. New initatives were being submitted a via the suggestion button, of which I added those who passed the eye test. A swarm of solidarity messages came pouring in from all over the world as well. Celebrities and public figures like Dua Lipa and Victoria Beckham shared the site on their social media. Between August 4th and August 7th, the total number of visitors to the site reached 2.6 Million. -->
