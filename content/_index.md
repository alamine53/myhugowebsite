I'm an economist by training and a programmer by practice. My main interests are in developing statistics and machine learning methods for high-dimensional data. I have a background as a professional athlete; and am a recreational guitarist and beat maker. 

Professionally, I am an ML Engineer at Mark Cuban Companies. My work has focused on using computer vision to extract insights on shooting biomechanics in basketball, creating educational AI activities for high school students, and developing pricing benchmarks for healthcare services in the United States. Prior to joining MCC, I helped develop ML models for macro risk management at the International Monetary Fund.

I completed my Master's of Arts in Applied Economics from Georgetown University in 2016, and my Bachelor's in Economics from the American University of Beirut in 2013. I was a starter on [Lebanon's Under-18 Men's National Team](https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964) at FIBA Asia in 2010.

## Help Lebanon Carrd

<!-- In 2020, I launched the above site as a landing page for resources on helping local Lebanese communities survive the economic crisis. Weeks later, it became the epicenter for disaster relief initatives as donations rushed in to support the victims of the August 4th Beirut port explosion. Following the blast, which killed 218 and left numerous without shelter, traffic on the site surged instantly, and I quickly repurposed it to cater for those looking for ways to help. New initatives were being submitted a via the suggestion button, of which I added those who passed the eye test. A swarm of solidarity messages came pouring in from all over the world as well. Celebrities and public figures like Dua Lipa and Victoria Beckham shared the site on their social media. Between August 4th and August 7th, the total number of visitors to the site reached 2.6 Million. -->
