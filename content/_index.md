## Bio 

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.png" alt="avatar">}}

Experienced researcher with a background in macroeconomics. Most recently, I worked as a Research Analyst doing machine learning for crisis prediction at the IMF.

As an ex-national basketball player, I'm interested in how successful sports dynasties are built. Specifically, I explore the role of coaching, player development, and roster distributions in shaping sustained success.
