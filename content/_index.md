## About me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.png" alt="avatar">}}

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Mark Cuban Companies, developing data-based tools for basketball coaching. Previously, I worked at the IMF's Risk Unit in Washington D.C, where I helped build crisis prediction models for risk management and contingency planning. 

I am a graduate of the American University of Beirut and hold a Master's of Arts in Applied Economics from Georgetown University. Prior to specializing in economics, I was a national basketball player for Team Lebanon U18. Here are [my stats](https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964) from FIBA Asia 2010.

1. ["HelpLebanon"](https://helplebanon.carrd.co/) is a web site I built as a landing page for resources on the Lebanese financial crisis at the beginning of 2020. In the wake of the Beirut Port explosion on August 4th of that year, it would receive more than 2.5 million visitors, channelling an estimated $2 to $3 Million in donation money to local NGOs. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/175wsn-18PNyWML7TmsUDiRTSIEaD7EgCVGfOKM4Kihc/edit?usp=sharing) is the full story in a presentation I gave a few months after.
