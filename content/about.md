I'm a self-taught programmer with a background in economics. I am currently an ML Engineer at Mark Cuban Companies where I lead the data and pricing efforts for a large healthcare project. Prior to joining MCC, I helped develop ML models for risk management at the International Monetary Fund.

I completed my MA in Applied Economics from Georgetown University in 2016, and my BA in Economics from the American University of Beirut in 2013. I was the starting point guard for [Lebanon's Under-18 Men's National Team](https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964) at FIBA Asia in 2010.
