Self-taught programmer with a background in statistics and economics. I'm interested in the study of peak performance, and the factors that enable it at the individual and collective level. Sports happen to be a great playground for that. I have competitive experience as a professional athlete; and am a recreational guitarist and beat maker. 

Professionally, I am an ML Engineer at Mark Cuban Companies. My work has focused on using computer vision to extract insights on shooting mechanics in basketball, creating educational AI activities for high school students, and developing price benchmarks for healthcare services in the United States. Prior to joining MCC, I helped develop ML models for risk management at the International Monetary Fund.

I completed my Master's of Arts in Applied Economics from Georgetown University in 2016, and my Bachelor's in Economics from the American University of Beirut in 2013. I was a starter on [Lebanon's Under-18 Men's National Team](https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964) at FIBA Asia in 2010.
