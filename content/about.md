I'm a self-taught programmer with a background in sports and economics. I'm interested in the study of what makes great sports teams great. Having competed professionally as an athlete, I understand that winning takes more than just talent. My goal to use statistics and machine learning tools to systematically measure the role of  coaching, team chemistry, and building a culture. I hope to one day use these findings to run my own sports team towards long-term success.

I am currently an ML Engineer at Mark Cuban Companies, where I focus on developing pricing benchmarks for healthcare services in the United States. Prior to joining MCC, I helped develop ML models for risk management at the International Monetary Fund.

I completed my MA in Applied Economics from Georgetown University in 2016, and my BA in Economics from the American University of Beirut in 2013. I was a starter on [Lebanon's Under-18 Men's National Team](https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964) at FIBA Asia in 2010.
