I'm a self-taught programmer with a background in economics. I currently work as an ML Engineer at Mark Cuban Companies, where I lead the data and pricing efforts for a large healthcare project. Prior to joining MCC, I helped develop ML models for risk management at the International Monetary Fund.

I have a Master's in Applied Economics from Georgetown University and a BA in Economics from the American University of Beirut. I was the starting point guard for Lebanon's under-18 national basketball eam at [FIBA Asia]((https://basketball.asia-basket.com/player/Ramzy-Al-Amine/Lebanon/Lebanese-U18-National-Team/204964)) in 2010.
