The Golden State Warriors entered the 2021-22 season with a hope of snatching a playoff spot; they now sit top of the league with their best start since the 72-win season. Much of their collective success can be explained by indidividual performances, with both key and role players exceeding expectations across the board. Steph Curry's Player Efficiency Rating (PER) of 27.4 is his best since the 2017-18 season. Andrew Wiggins's PER has crossed the 16 mark for the first time since 2015. Jordan Poole, Gary Payton II, and Nemanja Bjelica have all achieved near all-time highs across various performance metrics. Below is where the Warriors' current roster lies, individually, relative to previous seasons.

The Los Angeles Lakers, conversely, entered the season as overwhelming favorites, having gathered a star-studded cast to support their already-packed lineup. Their plan's failure can also be document through individual performances, with most of the roster performing miserably relative to previous seasons. In contrats with the Warriors, the Lakers' current season PERs (blue dots) figure in the bottom half of career seasons (gray dots), indicating poor performances by the players' own historical standards.

Fans and armchair analysts tend to judge a team's overall strengh by the amount of talent available: a roster with a greater number of seasoned players is deemed likely to win. I'd like to propose an a more meaningful indicator: how a current roster is performing relative to their own historical standards. A roster with players operating close to potential is better positioned for long-term success than one where a portion of talent is left on the table.
