The following is a talk I gave to high school students at the Mark Cuban Foundation AI bootcamp. It has been edited to fit into a blog form. You can watch the zoom [here](https://youtu.be/llUF-HQcioM?si=ABPS_iYe7dfuSQ0l). 

The goal of the talk is to convince students that even non-computer-science majors can learn AI, and that the most effective way to do so is by combining it with a hobby or area they are passionate about. The first section takes the audience on a personal journey and the second discusses key takeaways they can implement. 

## Part A: The backstory 

Growing up, all I wanted to be was a basketball player. My dream was to play in the NBA. It was a completely unreasonable dream, given that only one Lebanese-born player had ever made the NBA before. But I was convinced that with enough hard work, I could become the next Allen Iverson.

*My go-to move has always been AI's crossover dribble*

With time I got better and better, and eventually got recruited on the Lebanese Under-18 National Team. My favorite memory is scoring 14 points against China in the quarter finals. It was a huge achievement given the stakes, even though we lost the game by 31 points.

I was never one of the tallest or the fastest on the court, if that isn't obvious from the picture, but I could drain a lot of threes.

One day I woke up feeling like maybe a basketball career just wasn't in the books for me. It wasn't fun anymore, and the NBA dream seemed more distant than ever. It was time to come up with a plan B, so I travelled to the US to study economics.

It was a fresh start. Economics felt open for multiple career paths, and technical enough to acquire real skills. I learned about data and statistics, and how to write basic computer programs. But basketball didn't go away, and I became interested in applying my research skills onto sports.

The movie Moneyball had just come out. It told the story of a young economics grad who helped the Oakland A's achieve great success despite being on a tight budget. Peter's innovative use of statistics, which went against the team's traditional scouting methods, helped them identify hidden talent and use it strategically. I was inspired to do something similar for basketball.

NBA teams had already started using data to inform strategy. One of the ways is through shot charts, which display the most frequent and accurate shot locations. By tracking shot coordinates, teams can put their players in a position to success and limit the opposition from getting to their spots. On the left, we can see that the vast majority of Luka Doncic's attempts come from around the basket or straight away threes. Although he likes the left side of the court (yellow), he is more accurate from the right at 43% (in red). Conversely, Derrick Jones Jr. lives in the corners, where he isn't particularly dangerous from.

*Shot charts remain one of the main ways NBA teams make use of location data*

Advancements in AI have unlocked new possibilities. In addition to tracking the X and Y, we could now also track the Z axis by tracking the movement patterns for every joint in the body. This could open up tremendous applications for player evaluation, for instance in assessing ability to dribble with the off-hand. By assessing movement efficiency, teams could now preserve athletes for longer by reducing unnecessary actions. Finally, AI could help teams gain an edge in technique development and injury prevention. for example addressing weaknesses in shooting or running form, and catching injuries before they happen.

*With AI we can now track mody movements*

I was personally most intrigued in the ability to provide insight into shooting mechanics. I'd considered myself a good shooter and had developed principles on proper shooting technique. Teams could help players find their optimal shooting form, for example, by comparing their mechanics across makes and misses. What if we could break down what makes great shooters, and teach that to aspiring athletes. What if we could identify discrepancies between game and practice, and improve players’ shooting percentages in games. So, I started researching this project more deeply.

*I am most interested in shooting mechanics*

Here’s a quick overview of what goes into a project like this. This will be slightly technical so bear with me. If some of these concepts are new to you, don’t worry. You will likely become familiar with them by the end of the bootcamp. The result of us being able to do this is …

*Analyzing shooting mechanics involves object detection, pose estimation, and action recognition*

The idea is that we can start to measure shooting mechanics. Start to see how these measurements correlate with success. Also speed!So we can nudge players towards their optimal form.

## Part B: How does this apply to you? 

### 1. Combine two skill sets

I want you to think about combining two skill sets. It’s much easier to be great at two separate skills, than to be the best at one. Being the best requires a lot of factors outside of your control. Being great is achievable with deliberate practice and some level of commitment. 

Consider that one of your skill sets is cooking. Suppose this is everyone in the world at the skill of cooking. I would be somewhere around here. Not as good as most people, but i’ve seen worse here. So if Ramzy is here, Gordon Ramsay would be here. Your target should be to be in the top 20%. Why is that?

Suppose you develop another skill set, which is AI knowledge. Let’s say with enough work you crank the top 20% (of everyone in the world). Then if you combine your knowledge of AI with cooking ability, you will be creating a niche where you are one of the best. Perhaps you can develop an AI system that creates absolutely delicious recipes by utilizing out-of-the-box ingredient combinations that were previously inconceivable? 

![](/other-skill-histogram.png)

Two 20% give you a 4%. 

(go through the math)
I gave the example of cooking but this could be any hobby or passion that you have. The idea here is you want to have overlapping skills. Overlapping skills will make you uniquely valuable in places where you can apply your talents. To give another example, Steve Jobs was able to combine his passion for art & design with technology to create Apple.

### 2. Just get started 
Most people get paralyzed because they don’t know where to start. It doesn’t matter, just get started. Once again, let me illustrate with a graph. 

If you start today, here at the Mark Cuban Foundation bootcamp, let’s visualize where you’ll end up a year from now. Let’s assume that you will get 1% better every day. Look where that gets you. Those who choose to do nothing get 1% worse every day. Look where they end up. The initial period is called the valley of disappointment. This is where most people drop out. This period is tricky because it feels like you aren’t making any progress when you actually are. It’s important to stick through it and that you don’t give up when you are tempted to quit. Keep a long term perspective. I promise you that the results will show if you are persistent over time.

### 3. Build something

Learning by doing is the most fun way to learn. Build anything: a project, a website, a chart, a prototype, a design on a piece of paper. You will have a chance to work on a capstone project over the course of this bootcamp. 

It’s easier than ever to build stuff. There are so many tools out there for you to play around and get creative. Generative AI tools can help you brainstorm, chat, design, generate sound, image, and video, and make prototypes. They can even write the code for you. You can code without having to know how to code.

### 4. Show your work

Once you’re ready, don’t forget to show your work. Post about it, write a blog post or a research paper, and talk about it to your friends. Make sure you are able to speak knowledgeably and credibly about your project. And why not reach out to someone like Mark Cuban if you feel like your work can answer their business needs. Most people think there’s no way to help someone as famous and successful as Mark. But if you have information that you think his business might need, why not offer to help. If you sound credible, they will answer. 

## Final thoughts

This is a tremendous opportunity to kickstart your career. Make the most of it. Be creative. Think outside the box. Don’t be afraid to bring your own passion. Just like I merged AI with basketball, you can apply it to your interest too. I’m excited to see what you build. I will be available on Slack throughout the camp if you want to shoot me a message. Just remember, you too can make your dream come true!
