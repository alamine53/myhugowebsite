The following is a version of a talk I gave to high school students at the Mark Cuban Foundation AI bootcamp. It is my hope that by sharing it in a blog post it could reach students back home in Lebanon and the Arab world. I truly think everyone can learn AI.

## Part A: The backstory 

Growing up, all I wanted to be was a basketball player. My dream was to make the NBA. It was a completely unreasonable dream, given that only one Lebanese-born player had ever made the NBA before. But I was convinced that with enough hard work, I could become the next Allen Iverson.

With time, I got good enough to be recruited for the Lebanese Under-18 National Team. I was never one of the tallest or the fastest on the court, but I could drain a lot of threes. My favorite memory is scoring 14 points against China in the quarter final of the FIBA Asia 2010. It felt like a great achievement, even though we lost the game by 31 points.

One day I woke up feeling like maybe a basketball career just wasn't in the books for me. It wasn't fun anymore, and the NBA dream seemed more distant than ever. I wondered whether it's time to think of a plan B. So, I travelled to the US to study economics. 

It was a fresh start. Economics felt open for multiple career paths, and technical enough to acquire real skills. I learned about data and statistics, and how to write basic computer programs. But basketball didn't go away, and I became interested in applying my research skills onto sports. 

The movie Moneyball had just come out. It told the story of a young economics grad who helped the Oakland A's achieve great success despite being on a tight budget. Peter's innovative use of statistics, which went against the team's traditional scouting methods, helped them identify hidden talent and use it strategically. I was inspired to do something similar for basketball.
